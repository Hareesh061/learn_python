# f strings
# f strings are used to insert values into strings. They are more readable and easier to use than
# the format() method. They are also more powerful, as they can handle more complex formatting.



# str = "Hi my name is {} and im from {}"
# name = "hari"
# country = "india"
# print(str.format(name,country))


name = "hari"
cnt = "india"
print(f"hai im {name} and im from {cnt}")
